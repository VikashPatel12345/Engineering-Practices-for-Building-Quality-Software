1.The logical (intended) dependency is that observer depends on subject.
Ans= true

2. which seeks to simplify complex processes for a client by providing a API which hides the complicated calls/work needed, doesn't seem to fit.
What pattern does?
Ans- Adapter design pattern

3.Which pattern would fit well as a solution to this systems needs?
Ans- observer

4.In order to allow for this change, we want to make use of a pattern that will allow this kind of expansion while minimizing changes to the existing code.
What pattern would be best here?
Ans- Strategy Design Pattern

5.
Consider the statement "In the Strategy pattern, the context should hold references to the ConcreteStrategies."
Ans- When the context is tasked with deciding which strategy to use

6.
In the Observer pattern, one difficulty is that the Subject cannot pass an instance of itself to the Observer being updated, due to circular dependencies.
Ans- False

7.
Once a class has been had an Adapter pattern solution applied, it cannot be adapted again.
Ans-False

8.Factories are no longer useful when you apply the Strategy Pattern to a family of algorithms.
Ans- False

9.Observer is an implementation of the Dependency Inversion principle
Ans- True

10.Strategy Pattern helps maintain the Open/Closed Principle.
Ans- True
